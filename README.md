## 📦 Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/shadow-archetype.git
cd shadow-archetype
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## 🔧 Configuration
The project uses several key configurations:
- **TailwindCSS**: Custom theme configuration in `tailwind.config.js`
- **3D Models**: Managed in `src/data/assets.ts`
- **Animations**: Custom configurations using Framer Motion
- **Performance**: Virtual rendering and lazy loading strategies

## 🎯 Performance Optimizations
1. **Rendering Strategy**:
   - Card-reveal with random animations using Framer Motion
   - Selective rendering for active viewport content
   - Memory cleanup for unmounted components

2. **Loading Strategy**:
   - Viewport-based priority loading
   - Background loading for off-screen content
   - Adaptive loading based on user interaction

3. **Interaction Optimization**:
   - Debounced event handlers
   - Optimized state management
   - Smart preloading for predicted interactions

## 📱 PWA Support
The application includes full Progressive Web App support:
- Installable on mobile devices
- Offline capability
- Custom icons and splash screens
- Optimized mobile experience
